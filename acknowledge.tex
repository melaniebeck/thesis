Getting to this point in one's academic career requires the help and support of dozens of people. I hope I can name you all. Without a doubt in my mind, I know I would not be where I am today without my advisor, Claudia Scarlata.  She unwittingly saved me from transferring to the Statistics department by asking me to join her research group and telling me that female astronomers need to stick together. She's right. I will forever be grateful to her because I know staying in this program was the right choice. In addition to the myriad technical skills I gained from her, above all Claudia taught me how to be an assertive, confident researcher -- no bullshit.  She pushed me when I needed pushing and stood back when I needed space. She taught me the value in finishing a project even if I didn't love it -- publish! She also taught me how to navigate the sometimes turbulent interpersonal relationship between graduate student and advisor. I like to think we turned out not just as colleagues, but also friends (even if she does still get a little motherly..).  

I must also thank my unofficial co-adivsors, Lucy Fortson and Chris Lintott.  Chris taught me how to work independently, how to speak up when I need help,  how to effectively argue my position, and how to correctly interpret the British (do not underestimate how important this skill can be!). His ability to fit the pieces into the Big Picture helped me stay grounded. Lucy provided constant support. Her ability to navigate and communicate sdfasdfsf


For the past three years I've had the delightful fortune to be part of the Galaxy Zoo science team. 
The galaxy zoo team including Brooke, Karen, Stephen, Becky
